# Autoware- Low-speed Autonomy project 

> **Open-source Low Speed Autonomous Driving Stack** built on top of [Autoware Core](https://autoware.org/), targeting TRL-6 maturity, for use-cases such as warehousing, cargo transport, and industrial logistics.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The **LSA project** aims to deliver a production-feasible low-speed autonomous driving system by building upon the Autoware Core framework and tailoring it for low speed applications (â‰¤ 25 km/h). This project is initiated in collaboration with the **AWF Taiwan**, integrating the stack into a real-world vehicle and testing it with an anchor customer.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Define a **clear Operational Design Domain (ODD)** for low speed autonomy in industrial and logistics scenarios.
- Build a **cost-effective perception and autonomy stack** optimized for â‰¤ 25 km/h use-cases.
- Demonstrate functionality via **simulation** and **real-world vehicle integration**.
- Promote **open-source collaboration** within the AWF LSA work group and broader community.

---

## ðŸ—º 2025 Roadmap & Phases

### **Phase 1 â€“ Requirements & ODD Definition**
- Define target ODD: environment types, max speed, weather, operational constraints.
- Set cost constraints for production deployment.
- Refer to safety standards, ex. ISO 22737.

### **Phase 2 â€“ Design sensor configuration and deploy it on a prototype vehicle**
- Sensor configuration, and ECU design.
- Prototype vehicle setup.
- Vehicle DBW integration, and vehicle interface development.

### **Phase 3 â€“ Full Stack dev. & Simulation Demo**
- Implement Localization and control modules.
- Implement perception and planning modules.
- Integrate with simulator, ex. AWSIM, Carla.
- Deliver a video demo in simulation.

### **Phase 4 â€“ Real-world Vehicle Integration & Testing**
- Deploy stack to the prototype vehicle.
- Conduct field testing.
- Iterate and improve based on real-world environment feedback.
